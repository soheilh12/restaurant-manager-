# restaurant-manager
simple C code to manage foods in the menu and add orders, while saving info in a file for later use.

In this program, you can add a food and its price to the menu,
                 sort the foods that are already in the menu, or
                 add an order with customer name, food name, and date. And it saves everthing in files for later use.
                 The program also calculates the income of the restaurant.
